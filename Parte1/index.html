        <h2>TIMELINE</h2>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">1995–1998: OK Computer</li>
        <p>Radiohead released their third album, OK Computer, in May 1997. It found the band experimenting with song structures
            and incorporating ambient, avant-garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone to call the album a "stunning 
            art-rock tour de force"
        </p>

        <li style="font-weight: bold;"><span> 1998–2002: Kid A</span></li>
        <p>
            Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A, was released in October 2000. A departure from OK Computer, Kid A featured a minimalist and 
            textured style with more diverse instrumentation, including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz
             horns
        </p>

        <li style="font-weight: bold;">2004–2009:  In Rainbows </li>
        <p>
            Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows, on their website on 10 October 2007 as a download for any amount users 
            wanted, including £0. The landmark pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines worldwide and created 
            debate about the implications for the music industry
        </p>

        <li style="font-weight: bold;">22009–2012:  The King of Limbs </li>
        <p>
            Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs, on 18 February 2011 as a download from their website.
             Following the protracted recording and more conventional rock instrumentation of In Rainbows, Radiohead developed 
             The King of Limbs by sampling and looping their recordings with turntables.
